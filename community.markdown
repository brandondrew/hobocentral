# Hobo Community

Hobo is an open project -- please do get involved.

We have Google groups, an IRC channel (#hobo on freenode), and a [public issue tracker](http://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/dashboard) (using Lighthouse). You can browse the source and track changes at [GitHub](http://github.com/tablatom). GitHub also provides wikis for each sub-project

## Google Groups

* [Hobo Users](http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers)
* [Hobo Dev](http://groups.google.com/group/hobodev)

Prior to switching to google groups we host our own forums. Read the old posts here:
