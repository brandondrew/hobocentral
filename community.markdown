# Hobo Community

Hobo is an open project -- please do get involved.

We have [forums/mailing-lists](http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers), an IRC channel (#hobo on freenode), and a [public issue tracker](http://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/dashboard) (using Lighthouse). You can browse the source and track changes at [GitHub](http://github.com/tablatom). GitHub also provides wikis for each sub-project
