## Examples

### [beta.hobocentral.net](http://beta.hobocentral.net)

This is re-implementation of hobocentral.net as a Hobo app. The original idea was that the source code would serve as a great example of a full Hobo app. However, beta.hobocentral.net is built largely using a Hobo feature called Bundles. We don't really want to put too much emphasis on Bundles at this stage because it would be rather confusing for people who are still new to the core of Hobo.

So beta.hobocentral.net isn't getting much love at the moment. We're focussing on tutorial and references docs instead. Nevertheless, you can check out the source using subversion:

`svn checkout svn://hobocentral.net/hobo/hobocentral`
