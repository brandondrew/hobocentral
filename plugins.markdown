# Hobo Plugins

We're in the process of extracting various features from Hobo into their own plugins. So far we've done HoboSupport and HoboFields. Next up will be DRYML.

## [HoboFields](/hobofields)

HoboFields brings Hobo's rich-type system and migration generator to non-Hobo apps. HoboFields doesn't depend on any other part of Hobo.


## [HoboSupport](/hobosupport)

HoboSupport is a mixed bag of core Ruby extensions. It's currently distributed as a gem only. HoboSupport doesn't depend on any other part of Hobo.
